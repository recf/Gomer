Gomer is a small utility for managing your video game "pile".

Pile data is saved in a JSON file with the .pile extension. The JSON Schema of
the file can be found at link:{repo-link}/doc/schemas[].

There is no installer currently, so to use it, just extract the contents of the
zip file somewhere on your system and double-click gomer.exe.
