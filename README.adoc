Gomer is a small utility for managing your video game "pile".

Pile data is saved in a JSON file with the .pile extension. The JSON Schema of
the file can be found at link:{repo-link}/doc/schemas[].

There is no installer currently, so to use it, just put it somewhere on your
system and double-click gomer.exe.

== TODO

* `Psake` task to patch the version in this README file.
* `Psake` task to patch the date in this README file.
* `Psake` task to patch the version in appveyor.yml
* Look into Awestruct for generating gh-pages. That's what asciidoctor.org uses.
* Localization
* Better test coverage (i.e. any)
* Make the commands return IEnumerable<string> (probably) a la the `argh`
  wrapper for `argparse` from python.
